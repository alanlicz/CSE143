I learned the definition of fields and constructor and when should we declare a variable in the filed and when we should just use method like length(). I really like the ed class where you can see different material on each slide and altogether they are coherent. I think that’s way better then what I saw on CSE142. I found the stretch method challenging and in fact I spent 3 hours on it. I think the problem is I don’t really understand the method of ensureCapacity() and difference with just calling size. I found virtual ipl extremely helpful. I thought I need to wait for a long time like 15 minutes or longer but it turns out everytime its just 5 minutes top.
